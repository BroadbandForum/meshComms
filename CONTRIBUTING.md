# Contributing Guidelines

## Reporting bugs

Use [github issues](https://github.com/prplfoundation/prplMesh/issues) to report problems.

## Contributing code

Before you can contribute code, you must sign off the Developer Certificate of Origin below. You can do this by adding your name
and e-mail address below it and sending a pull request with that change.

Contributions are handled through [github pull requests](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#pr).

Please try to follow these rules:
* The commit messages should have a short but useful subject line.
* The commit message should explain why a change is made, what is done, and which other options were considered but not used.
